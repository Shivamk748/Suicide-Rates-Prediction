**Project Objective:**

The objective of this project is to analyze and predict suicide rates across different countries using machine learning techniques. By leveraging machine learning, this project seeks to offer data-driven insights into suicide trends, enabling policymakers, researchers, and health organizations to take proactive measures in suicide prevention across different countries.

**Problem Statement:**

### **Problem Statement:**  

Suicide is a major public health concern that affects individuals across various demographics and regions. Understanding the factors influencing suicide rates is crucial for implementing effective prevention strategies. However, due to the complexity of socio-economic, psychological, and environmental factors, accurately predicting suicide trends remains a challenge.  

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model that can analyze historical suicide data across different countries and identify key patterns influencing suicide rates. By utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, this study seeks to provide actionable insights that can assist policymakers and mental health professionals in formulating data-driven interventions to reduce suicide rates globally.
